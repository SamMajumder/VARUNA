    **Visual Analyzer for Regional Understanding of Numerical Atmospheric data**

    Named after the Hindu deity of sky, ocean, and celestial order, VARUNA is a tool for visualizing atmospheric forecasts derived from CMIP6 models on a regional scale. This tool enables you to select a region around a country, choose from a variety of climate models, and examine different climate variables across several Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).

    ## Learn more about CMIP6 models, climate forecasts, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
    1. [Simple explanation on CMIP6 and IPCC](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/)
    2. [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)
    3. [CMIP6](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/)

    ## Climate Models and Scenarios
    This tool enables the user to visualize forecasts from 35 CMIP6 global climate models. These models help predict how the climate could evolve based on various internal and external factors.

    The SSPs represent different pathways of socioeconomic development, affecting greenhouse gas emissions and land use in the future. The scenarios available in VARUNA include:
    - **SSP 126**: A sustainable path aiming for a low greenhouse gas concentration.
    - **SSP 245**: A middle-of-the-road scenario.
    - **SSP 370**: A high greenhouse gas emissions due to energy-intensive consumption.
    - **SSP 585**: The highest greenhouse gas emissions pathway, representing a future with no policy changes to curb emissions.

    A great resource to learn more about SSPs apart from the original publication: [Explainer on SSPs](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)

    ## Data Source:
    The NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset, provided by NASA Earth Exchange, comprises global downscaled climate scenarios derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs conducted under CMIP6. Developed in support of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, these high-resolution, bias-corrected projections are distributed through the Earth System Grid Federation. The dataset spans all four 'Tier 1' SSPs, offering insights into climate change impacts on processes sensitive to climate gradients and local topography.
